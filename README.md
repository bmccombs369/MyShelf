### This is an app for cataloging movies, books, coins or anything you collect. This version of the app only catalogs movies. For future versions I would like to allow the user to create their own model within a catalog so that things other than movies could be stored in it.

### As of right now you can create, read, update and destroy users. With the catalog you can create, read and destroy. I am currently working on allowing the user to create new movies, but the submission form is not currently working.
