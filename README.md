### This is an app for cataloging movies, books, coins or anything you collect. This version of the app only catalogs movies. For the next version I want to spend more time styling the app as well as making it more resposive for mobile users. For future versions I would like to allow the user to create their own model within a catalog so that things other than movies could be stored in it.

### As of right now you can create, read, update and destroy users. With the catalogs you can create, read and destroy. For the movies you can only add a new one. The goal is to have full CRUD for all three models.
